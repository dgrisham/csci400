	Demo: Overloaded methods/operators
	Corresponds to: RubyClasses.pptx
	
	This class represents a bottle of soda. We can
	- initialize
	- combine the contents of this and another bottle, return a new one
	- add the contents of another bottle to this one
	- split the contents among some number of people/bottles. Return
	a new bottle containing the split amount.
	- add some number of ounces to it
	- display it
	
=end

	# metaprogramming, provides read/write, read only or write only
	# access (not shown)
	attr_accessor :ounces
	attr_reader :label
	
	def initialize(label, ounces)
		@label = label
		@ounces = ounces
	end
	
	# simple method, returns a new bottle
	def add(other) 
		Bottle.new(@label, @ounces+other.ounces)
	end
	
	# modify the contents of this bottle - notice the ! 
	def add!(other) 
		@ounces += other.ounces
		other.ounces = 0
	end
	
	# split the contents - should this have ! in the name?
	def split(scalar)
		# local variable
		newOunces = @ounces / scalar
		@ounces -= newOunces
		Bottle.new(@label, newOunces)
	end
	
	# overloaded operator
	def +(amount)
		Bottle.new(@label, @ounces + amount)
	end

	def to_s
	    # with an accessor, don't need @ - why?
