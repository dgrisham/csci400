Homework: Ruby Style
====================

Purpose
-------

Get started with Ruby, learn the common style used.

Preparation
-----------

Ruby style resources:

-   <https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide>
-   <http://pathfindersoftware.com/2008/10/elements-of-ruby-style/>

It's good to think about style when learning a new language. For this lesson you
should:

1.  Browse the style guides listed at the top of the page (or feel free to find some
    on your own).
2.  Make a post on the **Ruby Style** discussion on Canvas (Piazza). List two
    style items that you think are noteworthy (whether you think it's a great
    idea, a bad idea, or something you hadn't thought of as a style issue). Why
    did you select those?
3.  Tag your post with `ruby_style` so that all style comments are in the same
    folder.
