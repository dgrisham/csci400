Introduction
============

Who am I?
---------

-   David Grisham
    -   dgrisham@mines.edu
-   Master's student under DJ Yang
    -   Distributed systems, game theory
-   Member of Protocol Labs
    -   [IPFS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVmypx9HGI), Filecoin

Why am I teaching PL?
---------------------

-   Took PL in 2014
-   Previous prof. (Cyndi Rader) retired
-   Experience/enjoyment

(also, `alias PL='Programming Languages'`)

Why are you taking PL?
----------------------

Is it worth an entire semester?

Motivation
----------

-   Toolbox
    -   Partly choose language based on problem
-   Crossover knowledge
    -   Haskell \ra C`++`
-   Research
    -   Type systems, memory management, ...

Motivation
----------

>   When the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
-   Abraham Maslow

What are we going to do?
========================

Roughly...
----------

1.  Discuss programming language concepts
2.  Explore languages/their paradigms
3.  Implement (simple) languages

PL Concepts
-----------

-   Syntax & features decisions
-   Code reuse, polymorphism
-   Error handling
-   [Type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)
-   Meta-programming

PL Concepts
-----------

What kind of criteria do you use to evaluate/choose a language?

[Categories of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type)

Exploring Languages
-------------------

                   Ruby                   Haskell   
-                  ------                 -------   
Paradigm           Multi, Object-oriented Functional
Typing             Dynamic                Static    
Meta-programming?  Yes                    With an extension

Exploring Languages
-------------------

### Ruby

-   Learn Ruby
    -   While keeping in mind higher-level PL concepts
-   Discussion on design/etc.
-   Exam

Exploring Languages
-------------------

### Haskell

-   Similar to Ruby
    -   But no exam
-   Implement simple (subsets of) programming languages
    -   Haskell experience
    -   Better understanding of PL implementation
