Introduction
============

Who am I?
---------

-   David Grisham
    -   dgrisham@mines.edu
-   Master's student under DJ Yang
    -   Distributed systems, game theory
-   Member of Protocol Labs
    -   [\link{IPFS}](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVmypx9HGI>), Filecoin

Why am I teaching PL?
---------------------

-   Took PL in 2014
-   Previous prof. (Cyndi Rader) retired
-   Experience/enjoyment

(also, `alias PL='Programming Languages'`)

Why are you taking PL?
----------------------

Is it worth an entire semester?

Motivation
----------

-   Toolbox
    -   Partly choose language based on problem
-   Crossover knowledge
    -   Haskell \ra C`++`
-   Research
    -   Type systems, memory management, ...

Motivation
----------

>   When the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
-   Abraham Maslow


What are we going to do?
========================

Roughly...
----------

1.  Discuss programming language concepts
2.  Explore specific languages/paradigms
3.  Implement (simple) languages

PL Concepts
-----------

-   Syntax & features decisions
-   Code reuse, polymorphism (DRY)
-   Error handling
-   [\link{Type system}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)
-   Meta-programming

Exploring Languages (Example Criteria)
--------------------------------------

                       **Ruby**               **Haskell**   
-                      --------               -----------
**Paradigm**           Multi, Object-oriented Functional
**Typing**             Dynamic                Static    
**Meta-programming?**  Yes                    With an extension

Exploring Languages
-------------------

### Ruby

-   Learn Ruby
    -   While keeping in mind higher-level PL concepts
-   Discussion on design/etc.
-   Exam

Exploring Languages
-------------------

### Haskell

-   Similar to Ruby
    -   But no exam
-   Implement simple (subsets of) programming languages
    -   Better understanding of PL implementation
    -   Assignments provided by Mattox Beckman @ UIUC


Criteria for Evalutating PLs
============================

Language Evaluation Criteria
----------------------------

What kind of criteria do you use to evaluate/choose a language?

[\link{Categories of programming languages}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type)

Example Criteria
-----------------

1.  **Writeability**: How easy is it to write a program?
2.  **Readability**: How easy is it to read a program?
3.  **Reliability**: Does it include features that help produce more reliable
    software?
4.  **Cost**: What costs are involved?

\footnotesize{Categories proposed by Sebesta}

(1,2) Write/Read-ability
------------------------

-   Support for abstraction
-   Control statements
-   Data types
-   Syntax
-   **Orthogonality**
-   **Expressivity**

Orthogonality
-------------

-   Small set of primitive constructs + ways of combining them
    -   E.g. variable assignment, `if`, `for`, ...
    -   Every syntactically correct combination is legal
    -   Meaning of a feature is independent of context
-   Example of non-orthogonality in `C`
    -   Arrays: Cannot be returned from a function
    -   `void`: Cannot be type of array element

Orthogonality
-------------

>   Orthogonality means that features can be used in any combination, the
    combinations all make sense, and the meaning of a given feature is
    **consistent** regardless of other features with which it is combined.\newline
-   **Michael Scott**

>   \blank{Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going. I
    just hope I find it along the way.\newline
-   Also Michael Scott}

Orthogonality
-------------

>   \faded[80]{Orthogonality means that features can be used in any combination, the
    combinations all make sense, and the meaning of a given feature is
    \textbf{\textit{consistent}} regardless of other features with which it is
    combined.\newline
-   \textbf{\textit{Michael Scott}}}

>   Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going. I
    just hope I find it along the way.\newline
-   **also Michael Scott**

(3) Reliability
---------------

-   Type checking
    -   Compiler- or run- time
-   Exception handling
-   Aliasing
    -   Multiple references to the same memory
-   Read/write-ability
    -   Unnatural algorithm implementations are less reliable

(4) Cost
--------

-   Learning curve
-   Fitting language to problem
-   Compiling, executing
-   Implementation support (e.g. free compilers)
-   Maintaining programs
    -   *How does this relate to PL?*

Other Criteria
--------------

-   Portability
    -   Moving between implementations
-   Generality
    -   Range of applications (tradeoff)
-   Well-definedness
    -   Completeness/precision of language definition


Language Design
===============

Design Tradeoffs
----------------

-   **Reliability** vs. **cost of execution**
    -   E.g. memory/type safety
-   **Readability** vs. **writeability**
    -   E.g. [\link{APL}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)#.22Pick_6.22_lottery_numbers)
-   **Flexibility** vs. **reliability**
    -   Pointers, types (`NULL`)

Expressivity

    -   Difficulty of implementating constructs/features
-   Users
    -   Care about writeability, eventually readability
-   Designers

Influences on Language Design
-----------------------------

-   Computer Architecture
-   Programming Metodologies

Influences: Computer Architecture
---------------------------------

\graphiccw{img/von_neumann.png}{4in}{von Neumann Architecture}

Influences: Computer Architecture
---------------------------------

-   Von Neumann architecture
    -   Data/programs stored in memory
    -   Memory separate from CPU
    -   Instructions/data piped from memory to CPU
-   Basis for imperative languages
    -   **Memory cells** \ra {\bf variables}
    -   **Piping** \ra  {\bf assignment}
    -   Binary \ra assembly \ra C

Influences: Programming Methodologies
-------------------------------------

**Time**   **Focus**
--------   ---------
*50s/60s*  Simple applications, computational effiency
*60s*      People-efficiency: Readability, control structures
*70s*      Process- to data- oriented
*80s*      Object oriented
*90s-Now*  Functional, Concurrent

Language Categories
-------------------

**Category**      **Characteristics**        **Examples**
----------        -----------------          ----------
*Procedural*      Variables, iteration       C, Pascal, Perl
*Functional*      Functions, composition     Scheme, Haskell
*Logic*           Rule-based, unordered      Prolog, SQL, K
*Object-oriented* Inheritance, late-binding  Java, C++, C#
*Markup*          Text + formatting/etc.     HTML, XML, Markdown
